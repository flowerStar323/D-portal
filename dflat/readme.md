Experimentation with flattening "full" iati data.

The idea is to have something that can expressed as a handful of tables and converted back to XML.

So it needs an understanding of the format but just enough to group the data sensibly.

This will be used for the new version of SAVI and possibly a full queryable IATI data backend at some point in the future.
